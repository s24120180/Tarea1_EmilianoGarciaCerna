//You have the employeeById function that gives you access to a database of employees of a company. Unfortunately, this function returns a value of the Employee? type, so the result can be null. Your goal is to write a function that returns the salary of an employee when their id is provided, or 0 if the employee is missing from the database.

data class Employee (val name: String, var salary: Int)
​
fun employeeById(id: Int) = when(id) {
    1 -> Employee("Mary", 20)
    2 -> null
    3 -> Employee("John", 21)
    4 -> Employee("Ann", 23)
    else -> null
}
​
fun salaryById(id: Int) = employeeById(id)?.salary ?: 0
​
fun main() {
    println((1..5).sumOf { id -> salaryById(id) })
}
